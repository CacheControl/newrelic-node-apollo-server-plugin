## 1.0.0 (07/15/2021)
* **BREAKING**: modifies transaction and operation segment/span naming to use deepest *unique* path instead of first deepest path.

  The deepest unique path is the deepest path in the selection set of a query where only one field was selected at each level. 'id' and '__typename' fields are automatically excluded from this decision. For example: `query { libraries { branch booksInStock magazinesInStock }}` will use the path name 'libraries' and  `query { libraries { branch __typename id }}` will use the path name 'libraries.branch'. For more information, see the latest [transaction naming documentation](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-node-apollo-server-plugin/blob/main/docs/transactions.md).

  This may result in naming changes for your existing GraphQL queries. Any charts, etc. where you are querying by transaction name will need to be updated upon upgrading.

* **BREAKING**: removed the deepest path attribute 'graphql.operation.deepestPath' from operation segments/spans.
* **BREAKING**: Removed support for Node v10.
* Added support for 3.x.x of `apollo-server` and the framework plugin integrations.
* Updated plugin to Ignore Service Definition and/or Health Check queries received from Federated Gateway Server.
  Setting config item(s) `captureServiceDefinitionQuery` and/or `captureHealthCheckQuery` to true will enable plugin to capture timings for those respective queries.
* Improved transaction names that contain InlineFragments(federated sub-graph calls, and union types)
* Added running `apollo-sever-hapi` versioned tests on node 16, `apollo-server-hapi@3.0.0`, `@hapi/hapi@20.1.x`.

## 0.3.0 (07/08/2021)
* Added Apollo Federation support.
  * Updated to always use the GraphQL document schema AST to generate the name and deepest path for transactions for a more consistent naming convention between federated gateway and standard Apollo servers.
  * Fixed segment nesting for Apollo Federation gateway operations.
* Updated `willSendResponse` hook to always grab the query from context.source.
* Provided a new config option, `captureIntrospectionQueries`, to ignore transactions for Introspection Queries.
  * `captureIntrospectionQueries` is defaulted to `false`.
* Added support for capturing persisted queries.
* Fixed crash when items lack a `name` property (InlineFragments).
* Added husky + lint staged to run linting on all staged files as a pre-commit git hook.

## 0.2.0 (05/25/2021)
* Added Node.js v16 to run CI pipeline steps
* Fixed the main field in package.json to point to proper location

  Thank you to @dnalborczyk for these contributions!

* Pinned fastify to a single version for apollo-server-fastify versioned testing.
* Upgraded tap and newrelic agent to latest
* Added husky + lint-staged to run linting on staged files as a pre-commit hook
* Pinned apollo-server-hapi versioned tests to only run on <16
* Bumped `@newrelic/test-utilities` to `^5.1.0`
* Added npm scripts and GitHub actions plumbing to run versioned test runner with appropriate flags for npm v7 and npm v6.

  Node 16 ships with npm v7 which has several different behaviors than npm v6. Testing found we need to ensure all packages are installed for each versioned test permutation which is handled via the --all flag in the new version of the versioned test runner.

## 0.1.3 (02/24/2021)

* Fixed issue where state loss introduced through another module could result in the plugin causing a query to error while trying to set the transaction name.
* Remove unused changelog file.

## 0.1.2 (11/10/2020)

* Fixed bug that would cause errors if transaction state loss occurred prior to plugin execution.

## 0.1.1 (10/29/2020)

* Fixed error when no query string is provided when using Automatic Persisted Queries

  Thank you to @MightySCollins for the contribution!

## 0.1.0 (10/23/2020)

* Initial release of the Node.js Apollo Server Plugin.
  * Transaction naming based on GraphQL query.
  * Segment/Span capture for operations and field resolution, including helpful attributes.
  * Error capture and assignment to appropriate span
  * Metrics for operations and field resolve
  * Excludes scalar fields from span/metric capture by default
  * Verified support for the following frameworks:
    * apollo-server
    * apollo-server-express
    * apollo-server-hapi
    * apollo-server-koa
    * apollo-server-fastify
    * apollo-server-lambda
